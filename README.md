# Heart Failure Prediction Using Decision Tree 

This project focuses on using the **Decision Tree algorithm** to predict heart failure based on patient medical data. It serves as a practical example of how a single machine learning model can be applied in a healthcare-related context.

## Overview

The dataset contains medical records of patients, including features such as:
- Age
- Anaemia
- Diabetes
- Ejection Fraction
- High Blood Pressure
- Serum Creatinine
- Smoking
- Platelets
- Serum Sodium

### Target Variable:
- **DEATH_EVENT**: Indicates whether the patient died during the follow-up period.

## Whatâ€™s Explored


- Data loading and basic preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Implementation of the **Decision Tree Classifier** from Scikit-learn
- Evaluation using accuracy and a confusion matrix
